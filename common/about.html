          <strong>About Me</strong> Welcome to the world of NoizCode! As an
          artist, I'm known for creating techno and ambient music, mostly
          techno. My live sets are a unique blend of improvisation, where I
          patch together different patterns based on the feelings I'm absorbing
          at the moment from the audience and the venue, creating an organic and
          aurally immersive experience for the audience. My music is
          characterized by its heavy reliance on percussion and rhythm, also a
          sometimes chaotic blend of textures and energetic synth lines. My
          journey into music began in the mid-'90s when I became part of the
          vibrant South Florida breakbeat and electronic music scene. It was
          during this time that I started producing music, a passion that has
          stayed with me ever since. Over the years, I've honed my sound and
          skills, crafting a distinctive musical identity that is high energy
          and hypnotic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>My Journey</strong> Music has always been an integral part of
          my life. From a young age, I was fascinated by the art of creating
          sounds and sought to replicate them whenever I could. My musical
          journey started with listening to '70s rock and disco albums, which
          eventually led me to explore diverse genres such as metal, jazz,
          hip-hop, and classical music. However, it was in the mid-'90s, when I
          began frequenting clubs, that I discovered my true passion: electronic
          music. I fell in love with the genre, and techno, in particular,
          resonated with me like no other. Since then, I've never looked back.
          Throughout my career, I've had several music releases and worked as a
          recording and mix engineer. But perhaps the most inspiring and
          satisfying part of my journey has been performing electronic music
          live. Using hardware sequencers, drum machines, and grooveboxes, I've
          embarked on a new chapter that continues to push the boundaries of my
          creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Musical Influences</strong> My music is a testament to the
          diverse range of artists who have influenced me. From non-electronic
          artists like Tool, Jimi Hendrix, and Black Sabbath to electronic
          visionaries like Carl Cox, Chris Liebing, Rødhåd, and Violet Nox, each
          has left a lasting imprint on my work. These influences have taught me
          the power of dynamics in music and the importance of subtle changes
          that can evoke deep emotions. Tool's ability to let songs breathe and
          find their path has been a guiding principle, while Carl Cox's live
          performances have shown me how to build up and break down sets
          dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Live Performances</strong> I've had the privilege of
          performing at various shows and events, including local hangouts like
          Mayday, Hotel Vernon, AS2220, The Keep, New England Synth Fest, Grave
          Rave, and Modular On The Spot Boston. My live performances are
          characterized by high-energy, rhythm-driven, raw hard techno that
          doesn't relent until the set is complete. My goal is to inspire people
          to dance and lose themselves in the relentless beats. One notable
          experience was performing at Grave Rave in Lincoln, RI, where the
          theme was the undead. It was a collaborative live event where I
          provided the rhythmic backbone for other performers to showcase their
          musical offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Latest Releases</strong> My latest release, "Deep Swell," is a
          journey into the depths of techno. This driving track narrates a
          fictitious interplanetary battle, with dark and swirling music that
          briefly pauses before plunging back into an unrelenting raw rhythm.
          The track is designed to take listeners on an immersive journey, with
          lyrics inspired by a friend who likened it to a space war. Currently,
          I'm working on a project to recreate "Noise Code," a production from
          over a decade ago. This reimagined version will be performed live as
          an immersive audio and video experience, promising an unforgettable
          sonic adventure.
